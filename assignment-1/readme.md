# CSCE 679 Data Visualization Assignment 1

In this task, you need to draw a **Matrix View** to visualize the **Monthly Temperature** of Hong Kong, where the color of each matrix cell encodes the temperature. You can find the data in [temperature_daily.csv](./temperature_daily.csv). You only need to focus on the last 10 years of data.

Here are the basic requirements:

1. In the matrix, the x direction indicates the year, and the y direction indicates the month. Each cell indicates the corresponding month of a specific year.

1. You need to visualize the maximum and minimum temperatures by month using the background color of each cell. Please use a mouse click to switch between the maximum and minimum temperatures.

1. When hovering the mouse on each cell, a tip should appear to show the date and the temperature value.

1. Add a mini line chart to each cell to show daily temperature changes. The x-axis represents the days in a month, and the y-axis represents the temperature.

1. A legend is needed to show the mapping between colors and values.

  An example is like this:

# Grading (detailed grading rubrics can be found under assignment 1 on Canvas):
1. Correctness (50%): All the requirements should be satisfied.
2. Readability (30%): The code should be human-readable (i.e., the names of the variables and functions should be intuitive, and there should be enough comments).
4. Maintainability (20%): The code should be modularized and easily modified.

# Submission:

Please create a GitHub repository under your GitHub account, and submit the URL of that repository to Canvas. 

# Notes:
1. You can use AI, and the interaction log with AI and your reflection on how AI is helpful need to be uploaded to your git repo.
2. D3.js is encouraged, while you can also use other programming language/tool.
